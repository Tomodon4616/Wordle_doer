# Wordle_doer
This repository contains Wordle_doer.py, a Python script designed to automate solving the daily Wordle puzzle on the New York Times website. It leverages Selenium for browser automation to interact with the game interface, input guesses, and read feedback. The solver initially used a random selection strategy, then was enhanced to incorporate word frequency data for more efficient and statistically-driven guessing. An accompanying script, wordle_eff_tester.py, allows for offline simulation to test the solver's performance and different strategies. See the [linked paper/report] for a detailed walkthrough of the project's development and analysis.
